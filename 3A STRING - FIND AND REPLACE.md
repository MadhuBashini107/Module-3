## STRING - FIND AND REPLACE

---

### AIM  
To write a Python function "convert" to accept a string and convert the uppercase character into lowercase character, lowercase character into uppercase  character.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Input a string `s` from the user.
3. Use the `swapcase()` method to convert all uppercase letters in `s` to lowercase and all lowercase letters to uppercase.
4. Store the converted string in a new variable (for example, `result`).
5. Display the converted string (`result`) to the user.
6. Terminate the program.

---

### PROGRAM

```python
def convert(s):
    print(s.swapcase())
```

### RESULT
Thus, the program that defines a function to accept a string and convert all its characters to the opposite case using the `swapcase()` method has been implemented and executed successfully.
