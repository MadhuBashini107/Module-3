## TUPLES - A TUPLE THAT COPIES 2ND AND 3RD ELEMENTS

---
### AIM
To write a Python program that copies the 2nd and 3rd elements from a given tuple into a new tuple.

---

### ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Input the original tuple from the user or use a predefined tuple.
3. Access the 2nd and 3rd elements of the tuple using indexing.
4. Store these elements in a new tuple.
5. Display the new tuple containing the selected elements.
6. End the program.

---
### PROGRAM

```python
#tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

tuple1 = eval(input())
tuple2 = (tuple1[1], tuple1[2])
print(tuple2)
```

### RESULT
Thus, the program that extracts the 2nd and 3rd elements from the given tuple and stores them into a new tuple has been implemented and executed successfully.
